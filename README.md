# MAPbBr3-Phonons
Animations of phonon modes associated with the paper "Low frequency vibrations and highly disordered molecules:  The importance of entropy for phase stability in the hybrid perovskite [CH$_3$NH$_3$]PbBr$_3$, revealed by inelastic neutron scattering and \textit{ab initio} lattice dynamics"

This has three main directories.

## Analysis
Contents
* The experimental and calculated energy loss spectra `Calc.csv` and `Expt.csv`.
* The electron density of the valence band maximum as depicted in Figure 2 of the paper `PARCHG_*`.
* The results of the phonon analysis of the phases `thermal_properties_*`.
* A notebook that shows the workings of converting the `thermal_properties` to the plot in Figure 3 of the paper.

## Movies
Contents
* An animated `.gif` of each of the phonon modes of the cubic phase (in the expanded $\sqrt(2) \times \sqrt(2) \times 1$ unit cell).

## Structures
Contents
* The relaxed DFT structures of each phase, used as the starting point for the phonon calculations.
